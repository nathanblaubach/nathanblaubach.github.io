      <h2>What is Crohn's?</h2>

      <p>The story won't make much sense if you don't know what Crohn's is, and that wouldn't help you be aware 
        of what it was! The basics of Crohn's (at least the way that I understand them) is that it is an autoimmune 
        disorder where the immune system is overactive, and is always inflamed. Inflammation is an effective means 
        for the immune system to fight off infection, but isn't "smart" enough to not kill bacteria and other things 
        necessary to digest food. The symptoms of the disease aren't necessarily consistent. There are periods of 
        remission and flare-ups. Basically this means that sometimes the disease and symptoms are pretty manageable, 
        and sometimes they need medical attention. If you want more info, you can go to the 
        <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Mayo Clinic's Website</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms and Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 8th grade. I missed a lot of school that year and even got a fancy letter 
        sent home from the principal about the “perceived absentee problem” that I had developed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first signs of something happening were not anything crazy. There were a lot of days where I would 
        experience hunger for parts of the day, but then not be hungry when meal time actually came. This is 
        believed to happen because digesting food is harder for the body, and causes a lot of discomfort. The 
        body then tricks itself into not being as hungry to avoid the pain. Over time, I went from just under 
        100lbs to around 75lbs. There were other symptoms along the way, such as fatigue and fun times in the 
        bathroom (also known as diarrhea), but I largely ignored all of these, because I have a pretty high pain 
        tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The symptom that did me in was stomach pain. This came from ulcers forming in the GI tract. These sharp
        pains felt like someone stuck a knife in my stomach at random times throughout the day. I remember 
        specifically once walking down the hallway of school to go to the bathroom, and I was hit by one of 
        these. The pain was bad enough that I had to drop to my knees on the floor and curl up to the point 
        where I was almost in the fetal position. At this point I finally realized that something was definitely 
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        The definitive test that determines whether you have Crohn's is a colonoscopy. Yes, that's the one 
        where they stick the camera in THERE!!! Not only is this something that you need for diagnosis, but 
        it's necessary to have routine colonoscopies every few years. This is because Crohn's patients have 
        a greatly increased risk of colon cancer. So, when all of you men who are reading this get old enough 
        to have colonoscopies to check for colon cancer, I'll probably be making fun of you as you complain 
        and freak out about what you have to do to prepare for yours when you have to start having them done.
      </p>

      <h2>I'm the lucky one</h2>

      <p>
        One important thing to note from above is the immediate progression from my parents effort to get help, 
        and being evaluated for Crohn's disease. I have an older sibling with Crohn's who had gone through 
        everything that I had. As I finally admitted to my parents that I was having this stomach pain, they 
        knew exactly where to take me. Most people with Crohn's don't have that luxury. There are a lot of 
        hospitals and clinics where there are not any staff who have encountered Crohn's and are not able to 
        figure out how to treat it. Because of this, many people (including my sister) spend a lot of time 
        running around to different doctors who have no clue what to do before finding someone who can figure 
        it out. Many are not able to start treatment in time, and as a result have to have parts of their GI 
        tract removed (sometimes the whole colon!)
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Crohn's isn't something that goes away. You don't cure it, you treat it. This usually looks like taking 
        immuno-suppressants in order to stop the immune system from becoming inflamed, and taking steroids to help 
        heal the damage that the disease has done. Usually taking steroids is only about a month or two long process, 
        whereas the immuno-suppressants are something that are taken continuously. As with most drugs, these have 
        interesting side effects, and sometimes can be dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prednisone is a steroid taken in pill form that I have had to use in the times of getting control over 
        flare-ups. This drug makes me feel great at first, because as I'm sure you know, it feels great when 
        stomach pain and diarrhea go away. Eventually the drug starts causing headaches of it's own though. The 
        main ones that I encounter when I take it are: huge appetite (literally always hungry at all times), mood 
        swings (almost started crying in front of a professor during his office hours) and soreness (I have to take 
        a hot shower to walk around without feeling sore).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first immuno-suppressant that I used was called azathioprine, which is also a pill. For the most part 
        doctors don't try this drug anymore, because it is very general in targeting the immune system, and leaves 
        the body more vulnerable to sickness. Another reason is that it actually only works for about 50% of 
        patients. This drug is cheap, so I was glad that it worked well for me. I got colds a lot more often and 
        they would last for quite a few weeks, but nothing compared to the Crohn's. This worked great until I had 
        a scare during my Junior year of college. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the week before finals, and I was spending over 12 hours a day trying to get all of the final 
        projects done for classes. On that Wednesday, I started to get a really bad headache, and I couldn't look 
        at a computer screen (which is necessary for projects when you are a software engineer). On Friday, things 
        hadn't gotten any better, and I was running a fever. I went into the Platteville ER, but they just gave me 
        some fluids and sent me on my merry way. I felt better for a few hours, but then my headache and fever came 
        back. Then, on Sunday (which was mother's day), I called my Mom in Milwaukee and asked her to pick me up in 
        Platteville to take me to the ER at Froedtert in Milwaukee, since that's where my doctor is, and I figured 
        he would be able to help me. She came to get me and over the next few days of headaches and fevers, the team 
        of people at Froedtert found that my white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were at virtually zero, so 
        I needed to stay there for a few days to recover while on a fairly constant stream of antibiotics so that my 
        immune system had a chance to recover. It was pretty clear at this point that I needed to switch medications 
        at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that whole fiasco, my doctor had me stop azathioprine right away. Since then, I have been on a drug 
        called Humira. Humira is what is called a biologic drug that targets a specific part of the immune system, 
        TNF, which is a protein that regulates inflammation specifically. Since starting Humira, I have noticed 
        that my body is able to get over colds in a more normal amount of time. Humira is also much different than 
        Azathioprine in that it is injected and it is expensive. The way that I take Humira is by injecting myself 
        in the stomach or legs every two weeks with what are called injection pens. I fortunately am not afraid of 
        needles, so it’s not a super big deal for me. However, the cost is a pretty big deal. A four week dose of 
        Humira costs $4383.63, which comes out to be $56987.19 a year! Fortunately I have insurance which breaks 
        those costs down to the point where they are actually quite manageable.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>

      <p>
        From day to day, my Crohn’s tends to be fairly well controlled. This doesn’t, however, mean that 
        everything is smooth sailing. One way that it affects me is going to the bathroom. It can be painful at 
        times to go to the bathroom, and I often feel a super strong urge to go when I really don’t need to. 
        Another big one is fatigue. This one can be frustrating especially when older people talk about how I’m 
        young and should be full of energy. The truth is that while I enjoy doing things after work outside the 
        house, I usually just don’t have the energy to do them. I usually feel like I need to stay home and rest 
        all the time. Fortunately my wife drags me out of the house from time to time to do things with her, and 
        I always end up having a good time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those things kind of seem trivial compared to the biggest challenge that I have really ever faced because 
        of Crohn’s. This challenge was more mental and emotional than physical. I struggled a lot with the idea 
        of ever getting married and starting a family, because of fear that I might get colon cancer or have 
        another emergency like the one during school and ultimately leave them behind. Another thing that I often 
        thought about was whether my kids will have this disease too and if that would be wrong for me to take 
        that chance. If you know me, you know that those fears have not taken control of my life. You know that 
        I don’t live in perpetual fear of the what ifs and the things that could happen (even though I do sometimes 
        worry about them still). I have been married to Hannah for almost two and a half years now, and our daughter 
        Sadie is almost one year and four months old. I am so thankful that I have the privilege of being a husband 
        to Hannah and a father to Sadie. Getting past the mental barriers was not some tremendous show of willpower. 
        I know that it was God working in my heart and teaching me that I can trust Him with the future. I know that 
        I can trust that living life the way that he designed it is the best way for me to live it. So for as long 
        as I have time to live on this earth, I want to spend it following Him and inviting others into the joyful 
        life that it is.
      </p>

      <h2>That's it!</h2>

      <p>
        So that’s my story with Crohn’s. There is more to it than this, but I just felt like I should share this 
        to let people know about what it is and how it can affect people. I hope that what you got out of this was 
        not “Oh, I feel so sorry for Nathan”. My intent is really mostly to spread the word about Crohn’s Disease, 
        so that those who have it or live around someone who does might be able to identify it if they haven’t yet, 
        and as an encouragement to those with either Crohn’s or Colitis. There are other people like you. You’re 
        not alone. There is hope.
